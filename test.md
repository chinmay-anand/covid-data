<details><summary>What is a product roadmap</summary>

  * A product roadmap is a long term development plan that gives product stakeholders the information they need to coordinate their planning.
  * Product roadmaps are extremely valuable even though not critical to success of business, even when we work in agile product development where short sprints are planned that too in a dynamic market environment.
  * The product roadmap gives predictability to the product development process, and everybody loves predictability.

<details><summary>How your product roadmap makes the <b>product stakeholders</b> more effective:</summary>

  * __Customers:__ The roadmap helps the large enterprise customers to make purchasing and inplementation decisions, especially when the industry is new and changing quickly.
  * __Customer-facing groups__ (sales/marketing/customer-support) - They use the product roadmap to develop their maretial like documentation and training and this work needs some lead time.
  * __Investors, board, sponsors:__ They need your product roadmap to estimate future revenues, and costs and decide what level of resources to allocate to your group including financial investments and hiring plans.
  * __Architects, engineers and designers:__ They can use the visibility provided by the road map to design higher-quality designs of the product.
    * Without the long-term plan the design will be in piecemeal and can create unforeseen problems. Also plans of other departments will fail without a longer term plan (product roadmap).
  * __Human resources:__ They may need to change their hiring plan.
  * __Legal:__ They may need to develop the contracts.
